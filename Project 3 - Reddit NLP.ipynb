    "Reddit is a community-based forum dubbed often as \"The frontage of the internet.\" Reddit has a central front-page, where it displays the top posts from many subreddits. These subreddits, are smaller, subdivided into sub-forums specific to topics, which are chosen by the members of reddit. Subreddits can be created by individual members and are typically self-moderated unless they violate the Reddit terms of service. Users can post their own content as well as repy to other's posts with comments. By utilizing the posts and comments system, we believe we can use supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict whether a given post came from one subreddit or another of our choosing. By training on these two subreddits of our choosing, we can possible reveal some intrcacies and trends that that may underly why some people post to one reddit or another. If our NLP can achieve this result with greater precision than a baseline model, we can walk away with some great insights.\n",

Lawyers who are also redditors also typically chime in with advice. r/relationship_advice pertains with people coming with relationoship issues and soliciting other members to weigh in on their topic. We believed these two forums would initially be hard to distinguish because a vast majority of times on r/relationship_advice, the questions pertain to divorce, getting a lawyer, and legal options given a bad breakup. Going forth, r/legaladvice will be \"s1\" (subreddit 1) and r/relationship_advice will be \"s2\" (subreddit 2) as they pertain to variables."

    "Gathering roughly 8,000 posts and 10,000 posts from each subreddit, the cleaning process led to very little loss in of data and as such, each subreddit was well-represented in the final classification model. No balancing of classes was required.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, analysis and optimization of grid searches over hyperparameters led to the following insights. From all NLP models -  Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classification, and XGBoost, it seemed like in general the Logistic Regression performed the best with the highest interpretability and least tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple grid search on the Logistic Regression parameters while it took several iterations, was much simpler than the fine tuning that a XGBoost required. It was simply much easier to get a good result with Logistic Regression. Results of training off the submission selftext typically scored nearly 0.99 and roughly 0.95/0.96 across most of the model. Understandably so, the use of XGBoost as the last model was extraneous, as there was not much room for improvement, and our results show that as such. XGBoost's fitting did not have room to perform much better. Given it's notable efficacy within the Machine Learning community, it is not hard to imagine that with even more tuning of the hyperparameters, XGBoost could beat all the other previously mentioned models. However, in this case, our subreddits were farther apart in terms of language than we initially estimated and NLP should be able to distinguish them close to 100% of the time. Most of the language we found that scored highly was very indicative of r/legaladvice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One extra note of insight we found was that training models on comments alone and lead to good post accuracy scores (~.99). However, training a model on selftext could only lead to scores in the neighborhood of (0.80) for identifying the subreddit given a comment. This suggests that selftexts are MORE indicative of a subreddit than the comments. And intuitively, we think this is true because there are many more comments than there are posts (most users comment, but few post) and these comments may come with much more variance than the possibly moderate posts. We may also theorize that posts are typically submitted by the most dedicated members of the subreddit and as such, are more representative of the community.\n"
